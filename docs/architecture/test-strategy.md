# Test Strategy

  * **Testing Philosophy**: We will employ a testing pyramid approach with a focus on writing a high number of fast, reliable unit tests and a smaller number of end-to-end tests.
  * **Unit Tests**: We will write unit tests to test individual functions and components in isolation. This is where we'll ensure that our business logic, data validation, and UI components work as expected.
  * **Integration Tests**: Integration tests will be used to ensure that different parts of our system, such as the API and the database, work together seamlessly.
  * **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: We will use **Playwright** to perform end-to-end testing, simulating real user scenarios to ensure that the entire application works as expected. These tests will cover critical user journeys like account creation, project management, and the full keyword research workflow.
  * **Test Data Management**: We will implement a clear strategy for managing test data, ensuring our tests are repeatable and reliable. This will be crucial for a multi-tenant application where data integrity is paramount.
