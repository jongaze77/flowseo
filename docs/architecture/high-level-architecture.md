# High Level Architecture

**Technical Summary**
This architecture will use a full-stack approach, combining a Node.js backend and a React frontend within a monorepo structure. This setup is ideal for a project that will have both an Electron desktop app and a web app, as it enables code sharing and consistent development across both platforms. We will be using Vercel for hosting and Neon as our database, ensuring a scalable and efficient infrastructure. This architecture is designed to support the key goals of process efficiency and data centralization as outlined in the PRD.

**Platform and Infrastructure Choice**

  * **Platform:** Vercel
  * **Key Services:** Neon (Postgres database), Vercel's Serverless Functions
  * **Deployment Host and Regions:** A single region (e.g., `us-east-1` in AWS) for the initial MVP.

**Repository Structure**

  * **Structure:** We will use a **monorepo** to house both the web application and the Electron desktop application.
  * **Monorepo Tool:** We will use a tool like **Turborepo** or **Nx** to manage the various packages and dependencies within the monorepo.
  * **Package Organization:** The monorepo will be organized into two main packages: an `apps` directory for the main applications and a `packages` directory for shared code, such as UI components and data schemas.
