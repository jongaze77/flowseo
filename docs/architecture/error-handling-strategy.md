# Error Handling Strategy

  * **General Approach**: The system will use a standardized error model across the entire application. All API error responses will follow a consistent format (e.g., a JSON object with a `code` and `message`). This ensures that the frontend can handle errors gracefully and consistently.
  * **Logging Standards**: We'll implement a centralized logging strategy using a Node.js library to capture and log errors, warnings, and other system events. We will define clear logging levels (e.g., `info`, `warn`, `error`) to ensure that we can quickly identify and troubleshoot issues.
  * **Frontend Error Handling**: The frontend will be designed to handle API errors gracefully. Instead of displaying raw error messages, it will present user-friendly messages and guide the user to a solution or a support channel.
  * **Backend Error Handling**: The backend will use middleware to centralize all error handling. This will ensure that all errors, including validation errors, database errors, and uncaught exceptions, are caught, logged, and returned to the frontend in a consistent format.
  * **Security**: We will ensure that no sensitive information (e.g., API keys, user data, server logs) is exposed in error messages.
