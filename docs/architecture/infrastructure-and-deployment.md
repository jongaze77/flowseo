# Infrastructure and Deployment

  * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: We'll take an IaC approach for all infrastructure resources, ensuring our environments are consistent and easily reproducible. This will be crucial for managing our Vercel and Neon configurations.
  * **Deployment Strategy**: The primary strategy will be automated deployment via a CI/CD pipeline triggered by commits to the main branch on GitHub. Vercel's native integration with GitHub is ideal for this, as it handles the build and deployment processes automatically.
  * **Environments**: We will establish the following environments to support our development workflow:
      * **Development**: A local environment for day-to-day development and testing.
      * **Staging**: A pre-production environment where we can test features before they go live.
      * **Production**: Our live environment for the public-facing application.
  * **Rollback Strategy**: In the event of a critical issue, our rollback strategy will be to revert to the previous successful commit on GitHub. Vercel's platform makes this process straightforward, as it keeps a history of all deployments.
