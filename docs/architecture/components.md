# Components

Based on the architectural patterns and tech stack, the application will be composed of the following major logical components:

  * **UI Component**: This is the React frontend. Its primary responsibility is all user-facing interactions, including the display of data, the user journey, and handling user input.
  * **API Service**: This is the Node.js backend. It will be the central hub for all business logic, data validation, and communication with the database.
  * **Database Service**: This is the Neon database. It's solely responsible for data persistence, storage, and retrieval.
  * **AI Service**: This service will handle all interactions with the user-provided AI models for generating keywords and other SEO elements.
  * **Data Scraper Service**: This service will be responsible for securely scraping and ingesting content from a given URL.
