# Security

  * **Authentication & Authorization**: We will implement a robust authentication mechanism to verify user identity. We will also define an authorization model to ensure that users can only access data and features they are authorized to use.
  * **Data Security**: We will protect all data in transit using HTTPS and data at rest using encryption. We will define strict rules for handling sensitive data, such as AI API keys and user credentials, to prevent unauthorized access.
  * **API & Service Security**: We will implement security controls at the API level, including input validation and rate limiting. This will protect our API from common attacks, such as SQL injection and brute-force attacks.
  * **Infrastructure Security**: We will define network security rules, such as firewalls and security groups, to protect our application's infrastructure. We will also follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring that our services only have access to the resources they need.
  * **Dependency Security**: We will use a dependency scanning tool to identify and address any known vulnerabilities in our third-party libraries. This is a crucial step in protecting our application from supply-chain attacks.
