### Final Product Requirements Document (PRD)

#### Goals and Background Context
* **Process Efficiency**: Reduce the time it takes to complete a full keyword optimization workflow for a single page.
* **Workflow Consistency**: Ensure a consistent and repeatable keyword research process across all projects.
* **Data Centralization**: Centralize all keyword data, eliminating the need to manage multiple spreadsheets.
* **Actionable Output**: Produce a final output of on-page SEO elements that is clear and immediately actionable.
* **Ease of Use**: Create an intuitive user interface that requires minimal training to use effectively.
* **Data Quality**: Increase the number of high-quality, long-tail keywords discovered per project.
* **Background Context**: The "Multi-Stage Keyword Optimization Tool" is a web application designed to guide users through a structured process for optimizing existing web content. The tool addresses the problem faced by SEO professionals who underutilize powerful keyword research tools due to the lack of a guided, iterative workflow. Existing solutions often present data in a fragmented way, leading to inefficient, manual processes and a loss of potential traffic to competitors. This tool will provide a prescriptive path to refine raw data into actionable insights for a small, geographically distributed team.
