# Story 1.2.5: Basic Authentication System

## Status
✅ COMPLETED

## Story
**As a** registered user,
**I want** to log in to my account and maintain my session,
**so that** I can access my tenant's features and manage users securely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can log in with username and password from existing registered accounts
2. System validates credentials against existing user database
3. Successful login establishes authenticated session with tenant context
4. User remains logged in across page navigation within session
5. User can log out and session is properly terminated
6. Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login page
7. Dashboard and user management pages require authentication
8. Current user and tenant information is available throughout the application
9. Login page handles authentication errors gracefully
10. Session expires appropriately and requires re-authentication

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Context:**
- **Story 1.1**: Registration system with User/Tenant models and password hashing
- **Story 1.2**: Dashboard and user management with authentication placeholders
- **Gap Identified**: User management cannot function without tenant context from authentication

**Authentication Architecture Requirements:**
- **Robust authentication mechanism** to verify user identity [Source: architecture/security.md#authentication-authorization]
- **Authorization model** to ensure users only access authorized data [Source: architecture/security.md#authentication-authorization]
- **API security controls** including input validation [Source: architecture/security.md#api-service-security]

**Database Schema Context:**
Existing User and Tenant models are sufficient [Source: Story 1.1 and 1.2]:
- User table with username, password_hash, tenant_id
- Password hashing with bcryptjs (cost factor 12) already implemented
- No additional database schema changes needed

**Integration Points with Story 1.2:**
From authentication gap analysis report:
- Replace `tenantId = null` with `const { tenantId } = useAuth()` in user management
- Add auth headers to API calls in user management components
- Update Navigation.tsx to show user menu and tenant context
- Estimated integration effort: 2-4 hours once auth system exists

**Tech Stack Requirements:**
- Use TypeScript for all development [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Zod for data validation on frontend and backend [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Next.js patterns for API routes and authentication
- Use existing bcryptjs for password verification
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Environment Configuration:**
- **JWT Secret**: Add JWT_SECRET to environment variables
- **Session Configuration**: Configure session duration and security settings
- **Dev Server Port**: Continue using port 3060 for consistency
- **Database**: Continue using flowseo_dev database

**Security Considerations:**
- **HTTPS for data in transit** [Source: architecture/security.md#data-security]
- **Secure session/JWT token storage** (httpOnly cookies recommended)
- **Input validation** for authentication endpoints [Source: architecture/security.md#api-service-security]
- **Rate limiting** for login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks
- **Session expiration** to limit exposure window
- **CSRF protection** for authentication endpoints

**File Locations:**
Following Next.js structure established in Stories 1.1 and 1.2:
- API routes: `/src/app/api/auth/` directory
- Authentication context: `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Authentication hooks: `/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`, `/src/hooks/useRequireAuth.ts`
- Login page: `/src/app/login/page.tsx`
- Protected route component: `/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- E2E tests: `/tests/authentication.spec.ts`

**Component Integration Requirements:**
Files that need updates from Story 1.2 authentication placeholders:
- `src/app/users/page.tsx` - Replace tenantId placeholder with auth context
- `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx` - Add user menu and tenant context
- `src/components/AddUserForm.tsx` - Use auth context for tenantId
- `src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx` - Add automatic login after registration

**Project Structure Notes:**
Maintains existing Next.js structure from Stories 1.1 and 1.2. Authentication system integrates cleanly with established patterns.

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All tests must pass for story completion [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Follow established testing patterns from Stories 1.1 and 1.2
- Test authentication integration with existing user management features
- Test session management and security requirements

**Git & Documentation Standards:**
- Feature branch: `feature/1.2.5-basic-authentication`
- Conventional commit format with Claude Code attribution
- Complete Dev Agent Record with commit hashes and quality gates
- Zero TypeScript/lint errors required before completion
