# Story 2.2: AI-Powered Keyword Generation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to use a custom AI model and prompt to generate an initial list of 100 potential keywords from the ingested content,
**so that** I can have a great starting point for my research.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can configure AI model settings and prompts for their tenant
2. User can trigger keyword generation from ingested page content
3. System generates approximately 100 keywords using AI analysis of page content
4. Generated keywords are saved to the database linked to the project
5. User can view the generated keyword list with clear presentation
6. User can copy keyword list to clipboard for external use
7. System provides feedback during AI processing with loading states
8. System handles AI service errors gracefully with custom error modals (no browser prompts)
9. AI prompt and model settings are tenant-scoped and reusable
10. Keyword generation respects authentication and project ownership

## Dev Notes

**Story 2.2 Context:**
- **Continuation of Epic 2**: Builds directly on Story 2.1 content ingestion foundation
- **Core Workflow Implementation**: Implements AI keyword generation stage from architecture
- **Next Story**: Story 2.3 will add CSV import to merge external keyword data

**Previous Story Foundation (Story 2.1):**
- **Page Entity**: Content ingestion complete with Page model and web scraping
- **Content Processing**: HTML/markdown content available for AI analysis
- **Project Integration**: Content linked to projects with authentication
- **UI Foundation**: Content ingestion workflow and navigation established

**Data Models:**
- **AI Prompt**: Entity for customizable prompt text and AI model selection [Source: architecture/data-models.md#ai-prompt]
- **Keyword List**: Entity for named lists of keywords within project [Source: architecture/data-models.md#keyword-list]
- **Keyword**: Entity for individual keywords with stats [Source: architecture/data-models.md#keyword]
- **Page**: Existing entity from Story 2.1 containing content for AI analysis

**Database Schema Requirements:**
New models needed for AI-powered keyword generation:
- AI Prompt: id, tenant_id, name, prompt_text, ai_model, created_at
- Keyword List: id, project_id, name, page_id, generated_at, created_at
- Keyword: id, keyword_list_id, text, search_volume, difficulty, created_at

**Component Architecture:**
- **AI Service**: Handles interactions with AI models for keyword generation [Source: architecture/components.md#ai-service]
- **UI Component**: React frontend for AI configuration and keyword display [Source: architecture/components.md#ui-component]
- **API Service**: Node.js backend for AI orchestration and keyword management [Source: architecture/components.md#api-service]
- **Database Service**: Neon database for keyword and AI prompt persistence [Source: architecture/components.md#database-service]

**Core Workflow Integration:**
This story implements the AI generation stage of keyword research workflow [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#keyword-research-workflow]:
1. Content ingestion (Story 2.1) ✅ Complete
2. API requests AI to generate keywords ✅ (This story)
3. AI returns 100 keywords ✅ (This story)
4. API saves keywords to database ✅ (This story)
5. App displays keywords ✅ (This story)
6. Copy to clipboard functionality ✅ (This story)

**Tech Stack Requirements:**
- Use TypeScript for all development [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Zod for data validation on frontend and backend [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Prisma for database ORM [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- AI service integration (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, or configurable provider)

**Environment Configuration:**
- **AI Service API Keys**: Add environment variables for AI provider authentication
- **AI Service URLs**: Configure endpoints for different AI providers
- **Rate Limiting**: Configure AI request limits and timeout settings
- **Dev Server Port**: Continue using port 3060 for consistency
- **Database**: Continue using flowseo_dev database
- **Authentication**: Reuse JWT_SECRET and session configuration

**Security Considerations:**
- **Tenant Isolation**: AI prompts and keywords scoped to user's tenant
- **Project Ownership**: Users can only generate keywords for their tenant's projects
- **AI API Key Security**: Secure storage and transmission of AI service credentials
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of AI services with proper throttling
- **Content Sanitization**: Ensure page content is safe for AI processing
- **Authentication Required**: All keyword operations require valid session

**UX Standards (Custom Modals):**
- **Custom Error Modals**: No browser default prompts for AI service failures
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during AI processing (potentially 10-30 seconds)
- **Professional UI**: Consistent styling with existing app design
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Smooth UX for keyword export functionality
- **Progress Indicators**: Show AI processing progress where possible

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Async AI Processing**: Handle long-running AI requests gracefully
- **Background Processing**: Consider queue system for heavy AI workloads
- **Response Caching**: Cache generated keywords to avoid redundant AI calls
- **Progressive Loading**: Display keywords as they're generated if possible
- **Timeout Handling**: Graceful degradation for slow AI responses

**Integration with Story 2.1 Foundation:**
Building on completed content ingestion:
- Use existing Page entities as input for AI keyword generation
- Leverage established project ownership validation
- Extend content workflow to include keyword generation step
- Use existing authentication and navigation patterns

**File Locations:**
Following Next.js structure from previous stories:
- API routes: `/src/app/api/v1/projects/[id]/pages/[pageId]/keywords/` directory
- AI service: `/src/lib/services/aiService.ts`
- Components: `/src/components/` directory (KeywordList, AISettingsForm, etc.)
- Shared UI components: `/src/components/ui/` directory (existing modals, new keyword components)
- Keyword pages: `/src/app/projects/[id]/keywords/page.tsx`
- E2E tests: `/tests/keyword-generation.spec.ts`
- Unit tests: Colocated with components and API routes

**AI Service Architecture:**
- **Provider Abstraction**: Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Prompt Templates**: Customizable prompts for different keyword generation strategies
- **Response Processing**: Parse and validate AI responses for keyword extraction
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of AI service outages and rate limits
- **Configuration Management**: Tenant-scoped AI settings and preferences

**Project Structure Notes:**
Maintains existing Next.js structure from Epic 1 and Story 2.1. AI keyword generation integrates cleanly with established authentication, project management, content ingestion, and UI patterns.

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
