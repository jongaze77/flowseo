# Story 1.3: Project Creation and Management

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to create, name, and manage multiple projects,
**so that** I can organize my work and keep data sets separate for different clients.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can create new projects with a unique name within their tenant
2. User can specify an optional domain for each project during creation
3. User can view a list of all projects within their tenant
4. User can edit project names and domains after creation
5. User can delete projects they no longer need
6. Project names must be unique within the tenant scope
7. Projects are automatically associated with the current user's tenant
8. User can access projects from navigation menu
9. System provides custom modal confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete) - no browser default prompts
10. Projects page shows project count and creation dates

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Context:**
- **Story 1.1**: User registration with User/Tenant models established
- **Story 1.2**: Dashboard and user management foundation with authentication placeholders
- **Story 1.2.5**: Complete authentication system with JWT, session management, and protected routes
- **Foundation Complete**: Full authentication context, protected routes, and user/tenant management working

**Authentication Integration:**
Story 1.2.5 completed authentication system provides:
- User and tenant context via useAuth hook
- Protected route middleware for automatic authentication
- JWT-based session management with secure cookies
- Complete integration with existing components

**Data Models:**
- **Project**: Represents keyword research project linked to tenant with domain [Source: architecture/data-models.md#project]
- **Tenant**: Central container for users and projects [Source: architecture/data-models.md#tenant]

**Database Schema:**
Project table already defined in architecture [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    domain VARCHAR(255),
    tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
    UNIQUE (name, tenant_id)
);
```

**API Specifications:**
Project creation endpoint specified in architecture [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/projects]:
- POST /projects endpoint for project creation
- Request body with name and domain fields
- Returns 201 on successful creation
- Need to extend with full CRUD operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)

**Tech Stack Requirements:**
- Use TypeScript for all development [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Zod for data validation on frontend and backend [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Prisma for database ORM [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use authentication context from Story 1.2.5 for tenant scope

**Environment Configuration:**
- **Dev Server Port**: Continue using port 3060 for consistency
- **Database**: Continue using flowseo_dev database
- **Authentication**: Reuse JWT_SECRET and session configuration from Story 1.2.5

**Security Considerations:**
- **Tenant Isolation**: Projects must be scoped to authenticated user's tenant
- **Authentication Required**: All project operations require valid session
- **Input Validation**: Project names and domains must be validated
- **Authorization**: Users can only access projects within their tenant
- **Data Integrity**: Project deletion should be confirmed to prevent accidents

**Component Architecture:**
- **UI Component**: React frontend handles project management interface [Source: architecture/components.md#ui-component]
- **API Service**: Node.js backend handles project CRUD and validation [Source: architecture/components.md#api-service]
- **Database Service**: Neon database for project data persistence [Source: architecture/components.md#database-service]

**File Locations:**
Following Next.js structure from previous stories:
- API routes: `/src/app/api/v1/projects/` directory
- Components: `/src/components/` directory (ProjectList, CreateProjectForm, EditProjectForm, ConfirmationModal)
- Shared UI components: `/src/components/ui/` directory (reusable ConfirmationModal)
- Projects page: `/src/app/projects/page.tsx`
- E2E tests: `/tests/projects.spec.ts`
- Unit tests: Colocated with components and API routes

**Integration with Existing Foundation:**
Building on completed authentication system:
- Use useAuth hook for tenant context in project operations
- Projects page will be protected route using ProtectedRoute component
- Navigation component will be updated to include Projects link
- Project API endpoints will use authentication middleware from Story 1.2.5

**Project Structure Notes:**
Maintains existing Next.js structure from Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.2.5. Project management integrates cleanly with established authentication and layout patterns.

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All tests must pass for story completion [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Follow established testing patterns from previous stories
- Test project CRUD operations with authentication context
- Test tenant isolation and project name uniqueness validation

**Git & Documentation Standards:**
- Feature branch: `feature/1.3-project-creation-management`
- Conventional commit format with Claude Code attribution
- Complete Dev Agent Record with commit hashes and quality gates
- Zero TypeScript/lint errors required before completion
