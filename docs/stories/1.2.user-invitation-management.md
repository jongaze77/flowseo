# Story 1.2: Basic App Foundation with User Management (MVP)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** tenant owner,
**I want** a basic dashboard with navigation to manage my team,
**so that** I can access user management and other tenant features after registration.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. After registration, user is redirected to a dashboard page
2. Dashboard displays tenant name and basic navigation menu
3. Navigation includes links to User Management and other future features
4. User Management page allows creating new users with username/password
5. User Management page displays list of all users in tenant
6. Tenant owner can remove users from their tenant
7. System validates unique usernames within tenant scope
8. New users are automatically associated with the tenant
9. User creation follows same validation patterns as registration
10. Basic app layout with header/navigation is established

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create post-registration dashboard and app layout (AC: 1, 2, 3, 10)
  - [x] Create /dashboard page as post-registration landing

  - [x] Implement GET /api/v1/tenants/:id/users endpoint for listing tenant users
  - [x] Implement DELETE /api/v1/tenants/:id/users/:userId endpoint for removing users
  - [x] Add username uniqueness validation within tenant scope
  - [x] Reuse password validation and hashing from Story 1.1
- [x] Task 3: Create user management UI components (AC: 4, 5, 6)

  - [x] Test navigation between pages works correctly
  - [x] Test username uniqueness validation edge cases
  - [x] Test user removal confirmation flow

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights from Story 1.1:**
- Database schema foundation established with User and Tenant models
- Environment configured for port 3060 and flowseo_dev database
- Registration API endpoint pattern established at /api/v1/tenants
- Zod validation patterns implemented for data validation
- bcryptjs used for password hashing (cost factor 12)
- Testing infrastructure set up with Jest and Playwright
- Registration form component created but **no post-registration UI exists**
- User lands nowhere after registration - needs dashboard redirect

**Data Models:**
- **User**: Existing model with username, password_hash, tenant_id [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
- **Tenant**: Existing model, central container for users [Source: architecture/data-models.md#tenant]

**Database Schema Requirements:**
Current schema has User and Tenant models [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]. No schema changes needed:
- User table already supports multiple users per tenant via tenant_id
- Username uniqueness constraint needs to be scoped to tenant level
- Existing password hashing can be reused

**API Specifications:**
No specific user management endpoints in current REST API spec [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]. Need to follow established patterns:
- Use /api/v1/ prefix following tenant creation pattern
- Return 201 for successful creation, appropriate error codes
- Implement RESTful endpoints for user CRUD operations within tenant scope

**Tech Stack Requirements:**
- Use TypeScript for all development [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Zod for data validation on frontend and backend [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Prisma for database ORM [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Playwright for E2E testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Environment Configuration Requirements:**
- **Dev Server Port**: Must use port 3060 (not default 3000) to avoid conflicts with other projects
- **Database Name**: Use `flowseo_dev` for PostgreSQL database
- **Environment Files**: No additional environment configuration needed (reuses Story 1.1 setup)

**Component Architecture:**
- **UI Component**: React frontend handles user-facing interactions [Source: architecture/components.md#ui-component]
- **API Service**: Node.js backend handles business logic and validation [Source: architecture/components.md#api-service]
- **Database Service**: Neon database for data persistence [Source: architecture/components.md#database-service]

**File Locations:**
Current project structure is standard Next.js:
- API routes: `/src/app/api/` directory
- Components: `/src/components/` directory (AppLayout, Navigation, UserList, AddUserForm)
- Database schema: `/prisma/schema.prisma`
- E2E tests: `/tests/` directory
- Pages: `/src/app/` directory (dashboard, users pages)
- Layout components: `/src/components/layout/` (for AppLayout, Navigation)

**Security Considerations:**
- Username uniqueness validation within tenant scope (not globally)
- Password validation and hashing using existing bcryptjs patterns
- Tenant ownership validation before user management actions
- Proper user removal without data corruption
- Navigation should validate user has access to tenant resources
- Session/state management for knowing current tenant context

**Project Structure Notes:**
The current project uses standard Next.js structure, not the monorepo structure shown in architecture docs. File locations should follow Next.js conventions.

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All tests must pass for story completion [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Follow established testing patterns from Story 1.1 (Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E)
- Test username uniqueness within tenant scope, not global uniqueness

**Git & Documentation Standards:**
- Feature branch: `feature/1.2-app-foundation-user-management`
- Conventional commit format with Claude Code attribution
- Complete Dev Agent Record with commit hashes and quality gates
- Zero TypeScript/lint errors required before completion
