* **Ease of Use**: Create an intuitive user interface that requires minimal training to use effectively.
* **Data Quality**: Increase the number of high-quality, long-tail keywords discovered per project.
* **Background Context**: The "Multi-Stage Keyword Optimization Tool" is a web application designed to guide users through a structured process for optimizing existing web content. The tool addresses the problem faced by SEO professionals who underutilize powerful keyword research tools due to the lack of a guided, iterative workflow. Existing solutions often present data in a fragmented way, leading to inefficient, manual processes and a loss of potential traffic to competitors. This tool will provide a prescriptive path to refine raw data into actionable insights for a small, geographically distributed team.
